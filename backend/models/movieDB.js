The price-performance ratio is internationally as good as unrivalled. For six days and nights, the brothel holidaymakers make their way from one amusement institution to the next. At the top of the itinerary are the so-called flat rate 'whorehouses', where one payment secures as much unlimited sex and drinks as one wants. It's a side of Germany most people have never heard of - let alone seen.",
