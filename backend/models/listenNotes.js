It sounds like he has a demanding white-collar job.  He was very complimentary of the podcast - one of his favorites was the <a href=\"http://whoapodcast.com/wreck-trout-creek-skeeter-bill/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">episode with cowboy Bill Mooney</a> - He encouraged us to keep producing them. Thanks Christian. I’ve had several emails back and forth with Christian.  His English is very good. Through the emails I’ve learned a little about his life and horsemanship in Germany. He gave me permission to share some of his story.</p> <p>Horsemanship in Germany is different.  According to Christian,  women and girls dominate the horse industry. Now, I'm not saying that like it's a bad thing, only to show that Christian had a few more hurdles to get to where he is today.  His family was not wealthy, either.  For him to pursue his passion for horses as a teenager was definitively a challenge.</p> <p>And, when you pursue a dream, sometimes luck has a way of finding you too.  After college, Christian worked for an international company that sent him to their plant in Evanston, Wyoming.  While there he visited a ranch where he found himself on the back of a horse once again.</p> <p>This is Christian's story.  I hope you enjoy it.</p> Join Us on this Journey <p>We want you to be a part of the show.  Tell us about your horse.  Share your challenges, triumphs, or just everyday items that make horse ownership unique.  Create an audio file using the memo app on your phone.  Or, contact me and we'll set up a time to talk by Skype or phone.  Perhaps what you have to share can help someone in THEIR horse journey.</p> <p>You are a big part of why we do this podcast.  We really love getting your feedback.  Please let us know your thoughts, ideas, and suggestions for the show.  Email us at <a href=\"mailto:john@whoapodcast.com\">John@WhoaPodcast.com</a></p> <p>Thanks for listening,</p> John & Ranae <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=49949&amp;refid=stpr\"></a> Episode #155 <p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jO1sZA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Support the Whoa Podcast with this Amazon Link.</a></p>",
